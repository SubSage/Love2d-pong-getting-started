<p>What this blog post aims to do is to demystify the black box with getting started in game development. There is a huge issue with getting started in video game development. I personally faced this challenge with getting started, and continue to read of countless others not knowing how to start. The trends I’ve seen are that once somebody knows how to start, they can iteratively get better at making games, each success and failure being the show of force that you’re learning. I’m aiming to get you all started today. Our sample project today will be a clone of Pong.</p>

<p>Please take very careful note of the following. This example will not have best practices, there could potentially even be little workarounds and hacks, (there’s at best 1 to be fair); the point I’m pushing at you is that this is by no means a final product of a game that includes all of the things to know about making games within it. This project will have many topics covered to get you started with a strong overall base and that’s it. In order to get started, please make sure you’re capable of running Love2d. You can read how to setup Love2d here <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started">https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started</a>

<p>Source code by Luis Martinez, although this code is very rough and avoids best/good practices for sake of brevity. An emphasis is placed on simplicity for beginners to computer science and programming. At best this should be seen as an attempt to whet newcomer programmers’ appetites for making video games.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>The basics, what are they? This is something that isn’t easy to answer with applicability, the basics for making a video game can change from person to person and there is no clear answer that everyone will accept as totally correct. Generally every game has a core game loop, and some form of interactivity between the player and the game. That’s as close to a specific as we can answer without getting into the philosophy of what is a game; let’s avoid the conversation of what composes video games. We’re going to make a ball move around on a screen and respond with collision to the walls/paddles, the paddles will be controlled by player input That’s the game we’re going to build here. I’ll provide code gists to follow along with explanations of the code being commented into the code. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Code
I remember first learning to program, everything I did was output/shown on the console. Most of you have had similar experiences so far. Many of us did. The thing we need to create in order to get some visuals on the screen is a window. That’s the actual technical jargon. Wanna use a different programming language to make a game? Lookup “how to draw/make window in ” (love2d).  We’re using Love2d which is built on the programming language named Lua. Let’s get our first game window up. </p>

<p>Awesome! We have a window and the world hasn’t ended, congratulations! Let’s add to our game little by little from here. The player should be able to control something, a rectangle for the paddle. Let’s create a paddle, with a location on the screen and give the player the ability to move it around by controlling the location of the paddle.
</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/SubSage/5bcaf701133e6fbb5d91302a29fbabf2.js"></script></p>
<p>Simple! We’ve defined a location for the player paddle and at each update check if the paddle should move left or right. Simple enough, let’s go ahead and add an enemy paddle along with a ball that moves around.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/SubSage/d984c9fb68d357aaf3c246f7f3d07a89.js"></script></p>

<p>Cool, we went ahead and let the player control the horizontal movement of both paddles for now, let’s just keep things simple. The ball moves around and when it collides with a wall, it’s moved back and given a new velocity in the opposite direction. Moving forward, let’s add more to our game, perhaps we could keep a score for the player, let’s also make sure the ball collides properly with the player paddle. </p>

<p>Hopefully you notice some extra changes here, we were using hard numbers in some cases to describe where the player paddle should be, the size of the paddle as well. It would serve us better to make these variables declared in the very beginning, we now have more control over them as well.</p>

<p>Just like that we have a not so finished clone of pong. Yes, it’s not finished, this is where you the reader should finish it. There are a few options for you here reader. Do you want to create an AI that controls the enemy paddle? Do you want to instead make the paddle be controlled by a second player? This really wouldn’t be a big amount of work to undertake, you already built everything else, give it a go!</p>
